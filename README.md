## About The Project

Hey there, nature enthusiasts! üå≤

When my brother, a dedicated forestry student navigating the vast world of trees, found himself swamped with leafy specimens and tangled twigs, he came to me with a mission. "Can you create an app to simplify the world of tree identification?", he asked. And thus, Tree ID was born!

Tree ID isn't just another tree identification app; it's a labor of love, cultivated by sibling collaboration. Built on a robust tree identification key, it endeavors to make the complex canopy of tree species as approachable as a stroll in the park. From the whispering pines to the stoic oaks, our app serves as your digital dendrology buddy, ensuring you never mistake a maple for a mahogany again!

So, whether you're a seasoned botanist or just starting to branch out in your tree-tracing journey, let Tree ID be the wind beneath your boughs. Dive into the forest of knowledge, one tap at a time!

Happy tree hunting! üçÉüîç
